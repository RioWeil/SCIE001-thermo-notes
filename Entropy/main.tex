\section{Entropy}
Entropy is central to the second and third laws of thermodynamics, as well as understanding the spontaneity of processes. It's a concept you'll see appear not only in physics, but in chemistry and biology as well.

\subsection{Types of Systems}
Just before we define our notion of this mysterious "entropy", it will help to define what different kinds of systems mean. An \textbf{Open system} is one in which both matter and energy can be exchanged with its environment. A \textbf{Closed system} is a system where energy can be exchanged with the environment, but no matter. Finally, an \textbf{isolated} system is where neither matter nor energy can be exchanged with the environment. \\
As a quick example, suppose my system is a half cup of water. If I leave the top of the cup open, it's an open system as the water molecules can evaporate and leave the cup. If I close the top of the cup, then it's a closed system as I can still give energy to the cup (say, by heating it in a microwave) even if the water molecules can't escape from it. If the cup is perfectly insulated and closed off, then its an isolated system as neither matter nor energy can enter or exit the cup. With this in mind, let's proceed with the most mindbending concept of this unit!
