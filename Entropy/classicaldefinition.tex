\subsection{The Classical Definition of Entropy}
Jumping right into things, entropy, for large systems, can be defined as
\begin{equation}
    dS=\frac{\delta Q_{rev}}{T}
\end{equation}
Where $dS$ is the change in entropy, $\delta Q_{rev}$ is heat reversibly flowing to/from a system, and $T$ is the temperature of the system. Just stating it right here, this equation probably seems to make \textbf{no} sense whatsoever, so let's step back a bit to build up to it.
