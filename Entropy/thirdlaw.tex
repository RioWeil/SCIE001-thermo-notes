\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{The 3\textsuperscript{rd} Law of Thermodynamics}{The 3rd Law of Thermodynamics}}
The third law of thermodynamics is that fix. It states that
\begin{center}
    \textbf{As the temperature of a system tends towards absolute zero, the entropy of the system tends towards a finite value.}
\end{center}
Great! That means that using zero as our reference point, we can calculate the entropy of the system at any other state.

But here's the thing (thing might be the 956\textsuperscript{th} time I've said this). We've figured our \textit{how} entropy behaves, and can use it to predict the future behaviour of the system. But we seem no closer to figuring out \textit{what} entropy is or \textit{why} it behaves the way it does. Luckily, someone else has already figured that out quite a while ago!
