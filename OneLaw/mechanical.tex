\subsection{Mechanical and Non-Mechanical Energy}
The 1\textsuperscript{st} law is all about the mechanical and non-mechanical transfer of energy, so its important that we understand the difference between the two. A mechanical transfer of energy is work. A non-mechanical transfer of energy is any transfer of energy that does no work. For example, say you put a pot on a hot stove-top. The pot will heat up, so it's obviously gaining energy, but there's no motion and therefore no work being done. Any non-mechanical transfers of energy like this are called heat\footnote{You can't say something "has heat" in the same way you can't say something "has work"!}.
