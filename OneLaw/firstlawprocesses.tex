\subsection{Thermodynamic Processes}
This subsection is devoted to all the different types of thermodynamic processes that we talk about in this course. Note that in all of these processes, we have that some quantity is held constant/is zero (e.g. volume, pressure, temperature, or no heat flow). Nearly all processes you will see in this course and in your exams will be one of these four types, but don't assume it will be unless you can justify it. Also note that there are quite a few derivations in this section (e.g. deriving the work done in an isothermal process). This is mainly to aid your understanding, and for exams, you can just use the final results to calculate whatever is relevant without worrying about the derivation.
