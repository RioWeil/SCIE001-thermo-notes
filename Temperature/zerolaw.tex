\subsection{\texorpdfstring{The 0\textsuperscript{th} Law of Thermodynamics}{The 0th Law of Thermodynamics}}
The 0\textsuperscript{th} law of Thermodynamics states that:
\begin{center}
    If systems A and B are in thermal equilibrium, and system B and C are in equilibrium, then systems A and C are in equilibrium.
\end{center}
This law may seem extremely silly to even bother stating, but there's actually a lot of things we can do with it! For example, this law allows us to construct thermometers as we know them (object B in the above definition is exactly a thermometer)!
