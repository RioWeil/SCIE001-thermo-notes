This is a not so brief overview of everything we've done (or will do) in thermodynamics this year. Note that at times, this document may go into more detail than you actually need to know, and it might not necessarily hit everything you need to know (even though we have tried very hard to cover everything). The information in this document was based off of material covered in the 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 cycles of Science One, so as a result, it might cover things that you don't learn this year, and miss some things that you do. This document is not meant to be your main source of information about the subject; treat it more as a document you can consult if you need a second explanation/clarification of a certain topic covered in lecture, or if you're looking for some more questions to practice after burning through the past midterms. Your textbook and lectures were created by people with PhDs, this document was written by two undergrads with too much time on their hands. Proceed at your own risk.
